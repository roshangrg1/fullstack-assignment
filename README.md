## Lesson I Learned from the Assignment:

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the recent MERN stack book ecommerce project/assignment and share the valuable lessons I have learned from it.

Inorder to impress recruiter during the project, I made the mistake of trying to implement each and every feature associated with the MERN stack book ecommerce. This approach resulted in an overly complex project that exceeded the project's requirements and scope.

The main lesson I have learned from this experience is the importance of prioritizing and focusing on the core objectives of a project. It is crucial to clearly understand the project requirements and scope and develop a plan that aligns with those goals. By identifying and focusing on essential features, we can avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure a more streamlined development process.

I now recognize the value of careful evaluation and planning before diving into implementation. This includes considering the project's goals, assessing the necessity of each feature, and seeking feedback from team members or project stakeholders. This approach will help me avoid similar pitfalls in the future and contribute to more efficient and successful projects.

I am committed to applying these lessons learned to my future work. I will actively seek opportunities to improve my decision-making process, collaborate effectively with team members, and deliver high-quality work that aligns with project objectives.

Once again, I want to express my appreciation for considering my application.

Your Sincerely ,

Roshan Guragain
